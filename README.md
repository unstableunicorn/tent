# Tent
Tent is a cli utility for printing the Nova Console Tent(get it? consultant but for the tech nerds) of the year
This is a totally very silly pointless project for a bit of fun.

## Installation
I'll do the whole release thing soon but hopefully you just curl your version:
```
curl TODO
```

Alternatively you can use the Docker images now:
```
docker run --rm unstableunicorn/tent help
```

## Usage
Just play around a bit with help, will only list the base help here:
```
>tent help
So you want to know who the console tent was for a particular year?
Perhaps you want to know which year someone was a console tent?
Or you just want to print a tent in your console?
Then look no further!
Just type the year like so:
 tent 2021
or their first name:
 tent Phil
If you want a list, well I can give you a list:
 tent list
The rest of this amazing application you can explore by yourself.

Usage:
  tent [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  grab        Grab the person
  help        Help about any command
  justthetent Just show me the tent
  mumble      If said softly you might find what you need
  yell        Show me all the console tents

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for tent
  -t, --inatent   if you want to more tent, this is how you get more tent

Use "tent [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Lets leave it there for now
